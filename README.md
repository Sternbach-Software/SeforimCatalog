# SeforimCatalog 


This is a fast, beautiful, and powerful program for searching a catalog of seforim. It can search by exact match, malei/chaseir insensitivity, and Shoresh search (good for finding a sefer with an approximate title, among other things). I would love to spread it to other yeshivos for free. if you would like to use it, please let me know so I can keep tabs on the user base. Feel free to reach out if you need help setting it up.
