# SeforimCatalog 


This is a fast, beautiful, and powerful program for searching a catalog of seforim. It can search by exact match, malei/chaseir insensitivity, and Shoresh search (good for finding a sefer with an approximate title, among other things). I would love to spread it to other yeshivos for free. if you would like to use it, please let me know so I can keep tabs on the user base. Feel free to reach out if you need help setting it up.


# Installation

This repository contains the source code for the program. A more user-friendly installation repository is available at https://github.com/Sternbach-Software/YGW-Seforim-Catalog. Installation instructions are available there.

# License 
The shoresh search is partially based on [HebMorph](https://github.com/synhershko/HebMorph) (this software adds נפעל support and reduces lemmas to roots), which is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.
